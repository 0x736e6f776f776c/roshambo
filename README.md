# roshambo
Simple Python script to play Rock-Paper-Scissors / roshambo against the computer.
You can play with alternative options.

## Installation instructions

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/techsnowowl/roshambo.git
```

2. cd into the game's folder

```
cd roshambo
```

3. Run the Python script

python3 roshambo.py
```

### Some play instructions
1. You can check your rating either ingame by typing '!rating' or in the 'rating.txt' text file.
2. You should **always** exit the game by typing '!exit' when picking an option. If you end the script in any other way, your rating won't be updated.
3. You have the option to play with alternative options. You will be asked to enter you options after entering your name. If you want to use default options, just press enter to continue. 
If you do want to use alternative options, enter them seperated by commas--e.g., ```(snake,king,queen,pig,assassin,guardian,lion)```

### Have fun!
